## community-gists

Our "gist" GitHub repository is typically used to share files and snippets with others quickly. 
You can upload new gists and browse other gists that uploaded by the Overwolf developer's community.

**Note** We confirm every Pull Request and sometimes review and test it, but make sure to check it as well before you use it in a production environment.
